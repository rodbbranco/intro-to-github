    <h2 class="tx-orange">How it all started</h2>

    <p><strong>Rodrigo's</strong> journey to become a <em>front-end developer</em> started with a project with his <strong>dad</strong>. <br>
        His dad, a seasoned <em>full-stack developer</em>, was always complaining about how there was a shortage of good developers in the market. <br>
        <strong>Rodrigo</strong>, always eager to make his <strong>dad</strong> proud, decided to take up the development. <br>
        Little did he know, he was in for a wild ride.</p>

    <p>His first encounter with HTML was an epic disaster. <br>
        He thought HTML stood for <strong>"How to Make Lasagna."</strong><br>
        He was so confident in his newfound knowledge that he decided to make a website about lasagna. <br>
        His dad was mortified when he saw the website, but to Rodrigo's surprise, his dad was impressed by his creativity.</p>

    <p>From that day on, Rodrigo's dad took on the role of a mentor, guiding him through the world of development. <br>
        Rodrigo learned about HTML tags, <em>CSS styles, and JavaScript functions</em>, but he never forgot his love for lasagna. <br>
        He created a website about the history of lasagna and even added a recipe section.</p>

    <p><strong>Rodrigo's dad</strong> was proud of his son's progress, but he couldn't help but tease him about his love for lasagna. <br>
        Whenever Rodrigo got stuck on a coding problem, his dad would say, <em>"Just add a little more tomato sauce, and it will all come together."</em></p>

    <p>In the end, <strong>Rodrigo</strong> became a skilled <em>front-end developer</em> and was even hired by a top tech company. <br>
        He never forgot his roots and still had a special place in his heart for lasagna. <br>
        Whenever he needed a break from coding, he would whip up a batch of lasagna, and his coworkers would gather around his desk, mesmerized by the delicious aroma.</p>

    <p style="padding-bottom: 30px"> The story of <strong>Rodrigo</strong>, the <em>lasagna-loving front-end developer</em>, is a reminder that everyone has to start somewhere, <br>
        and sometimes, it's the quirky things that make us unique and <strong>set us apart from the rest.</strong></p>
